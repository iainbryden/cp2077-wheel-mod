// Self-discovering struct offsets via the game's own RTTI system.
//
// (Header includes std::initializer_list for the dump helpers below.)
//
// CP2077's scripting RTTI registers every script-visible field on every
// script-visible class as a CProperty with a valueOffset. We look those
// up by name at plugin load: `vehicleBaseObject.physicsData`,
// `vehiclePhysicsData.velocity`, etc. The results are cached in statics
// and exposed via small accessors.
//
// Scope: only the classes that ARE reflection-registered are read here.
// Empirically verified 2026-04-30: vehicleWheeledPhysics / vehicleCarPhysics
// / vehicleBikePhysics / physicsVehiclePhysicsInsert1 are NOT RTTI-visible
// (`class not found` on every lookup). For those, the redesign reads
// authored values from TweakDB record classes instead — see
// gwheel/src/tweakdb_physics.{h,cpp}. Per-tick live state from those
// non-RTTI structs is read via hardcoded offsets (see
// gwheel/src/vehicle_physics_ext.h::fallback).
//
// Missing offsets (e.g., a field that isn't RTTI-exposed on this build)
// return 0 from the accessor; callers should gate on that and fall back
// to whatever behaviour makes sense when the signal is unavailable.

    // consistently produces a semantically valid value is the real field.
    // This is a scanning/diagnostic pass — it doesn't mutate any cached
    // offsets. Callers (or operators reading the log) identify consistent
    // offsets and hardcode them afterwards.

    //
    // Strategy: known-state snapshot dumps. Driver inputs already tell us
    // when the chassis is in a specific live-state regime — upright vs
    // leaning, straight vs cornering, accel vs brake. We dump the full
    // float layout once per regime, latched per session. Cross-regime diffs
    // identify which offsets are live signals and which way they swing.

    //   Hard-brake    — brake near 1.0, speed > threshold
    //   Hard-accel    — throttle near 1.0, no brake, moving
    //
