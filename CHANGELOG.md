# Changelog

## 2.31.2 — 2026-05-30

### Stability

- Fixed an audio session re-registration leak that grew the process's memory and per-session callback list without bound. The 250 ms poll that re-attaches Game Bar / Volume Mixer listeners deduped by `IAudioSessionControl*` interface pointer, but the COM enumerator hands back a fresh pointer per `GetSession()` call for the same logical session, so the dedup never matched. Every poll re-registered the listener and re-pushed the session. Symptom on long city drives: escalating hitches, eventual crash. Now deduped by `IAudioSessionControl2::GetSessionInstanceIdentifier`, the stable per-session string.

### Logging

- Both Logitech range-readback APIs are now logged side-by-side at bind time so a corrupt G HUB IPC layer is visible at a glance: `range readback at bind: SDK=N G HUB properties=M (divergence or FAILED on either side suggests a corrupt G HUB install)`.
- Range changes log the resulting FFB scale: `operating range (G HUB): 360 -> 180 deg (FFB scale: 0.50 -> 1.00)`.
- The active rangeScale logs once each time it crosses to a new bucket: `FFB range-scale active: 1.00 (range=180 deg)`. No per-frame spam.
- Toggling debug logging in Mod Settings emits an info-level confirmation so users can verify in the log file that the checkbox actually propagated.

### Documentation

- Troubleshooting now covers the "G HUB operating-range slider doesn't seem to affect anything" symptom and how to confirm it from the log file.

## 2.31.1 — 2026-05-03

### Bindings UX

- Every wheel-button binding is now a press-to-bind slot wired through Mod Settings' new `InputBinding` primitive. Each slot accepts two bindings (dual-keybinding pair widget), so two wheel buttons can drive the same in-game action.
- Bindings are action-keyed: settings list each in-game action ("Horn", "Open map", "Shoot primary"...) and you assign wheel buttons to it, instead of choosing an action per physical button.
- Defaults are intentionally empty. New users bind from scratch; the `Steering & pedals` section is the first thing to set up. The previous D-pad-to-Menu defaults are gone.
- New categories: Steering & pedals, Driving, Camera, Combat, Weapons, Radio, Gameplay, Menus, Menu navigation. The old single Button bindings / Lower-cluster bindings sections are retired.

### Wheel input

- Steering deadzone (0-15%) filters small wheel-center jitter so the car doesn't drift when your hands are off the wheel.
- Response curve: Default (linear), Subdued (relaxed near center), Sharp (tight near center).
- Invert steering: reverse the wheel's steering direction for inverted-mount setups. FFB follows automatically.
- `Treat clutch as brake` is removed; bind your clutch axis to the Brake action instead.

### Force feedback

- Renamed `Hardware sign flip (G923 quirk)` to `Invert FFB direction` for clarity.
- Added `Speed-sensitive stiffness` toggle: on (default) firms the wheel up at speed (sportscar-style assist); off is pure tire-force feedback (BeamNG-like).

### Physics

- Per-vehicle physics readout (turn rate, wheelbase, wheel grip) now goes through TweakDB record lookup with a per-mount cache, replacing the previous live-RTTI struct walk for the values TweakDB authors. Per-tick state still uses hardcoded struct offsets.

### Distribution / packaging

- FOMOD installer pre-warns about the four-file Mod Settings conflict (`mod_settings.dll`, `packed.reds`, `ModSettings.archive`, `ModSettings.archive.xl`) on its first page, so users know what to pick before Vortex shows the deploy-time prompt.
- Zip-mode `deploy.ps1` now ships the patched mod_settings `packed.reds`, `ModSettings.archive`, and `ModSettings.archive.xl`, plus `gwheel_input_provider.reds`. Without these, the new press-to-bind UI never compiled in-game on Vortex installs (direct-deploy was unaffected).

## 2.31.0 — 2026-04-25

First public release. Tested against Cyberpunk 2077 patch 2.31 (build 5294808).

### Wheel I/O

- Wheel input and force feedback go through the official Logitech Steering Wheel SDK (vendored under `gwheel/vendor/LogitechSDK/`). DirectInput enumeration, the ViGEmBus virtual-pad bridge, and the XInput-hook routing layer are all gone.
- Hardware capability detection: the plugin reads which features each wheel actually has (FFB motor, rev-strip LEDs, lower-cluster cluster) and seeds `red4ext/plugins/mod_settings/user.ini` at load time so the in-game Settings page only shows sections relevant to the connected hardware.

### Vehicle input injection

- Vehicle input is delivered via a detour on `vehicle::BaseObject::UpdateVehicleCameraInput`, resolved through RED4ext's `UniversalRelocBase::Resolve(501486464u)`. Function-address drift across game patches is now RED4ext's concern; their address database ships per-patch.
- Injection is gated on a cached player-vehicle pointer published from `gwheel_mount.reds` via `GWheel_SetPlayerVehicle` / `GWheel_ClearPlayerVehicle`. The detour fires for every visible vehicle each tick; without this gate the plugin would remote-drive parked cars and AI traffic.
- Empirical struct field offsets (CP2077 v2.31): steer +0x278, throttle +0x264, brake +0x268.

### Force feedback model

- Per-car physics-driven FFB derived from the game's `WheeledPhysics` (turn rate, wheelbase) and per-tick chassis state. Layered SDK effects: passive spring (speed² + yaw bonus), active alignment torque (humped curve × load × grip × weight), damper, road-surface SINE, airborne shake.
- Road-texture envelope: signal is `|Δω_roll| + |Δω_pitch| + 0.8·|Δvz|`. Asymmetric envelope (slow attack, fast decay) plays curbs as one-shot jolts and rough pavement as continuous hum without 5 Hz drone artifacts.
- Collision jolts via `@wrapMethod(VehicleObject) OnVehicleBumpEvent`. Kick is computed in the player's world-right frame regardless of which side of the impact received the event, so the wheel kicks AWAY from impacts.
- Slip-angle countersteer from car-local lateral velocity dotted against world-right; gated on `(1 - gripFactor)` so it only activates when the car is actually sliding.
- Per-effect SDK magnitudes scaled by user FFB strength via `wheel::SetGlobalStrength` (the Logitech Properties API is broken on most G HUB builds; per-effect multipliers are the workaround).
- 200 ms watchdog in the pump thread tears down all effects when the vehicle detour stops firing (pause menu, unmount, etc.).

### Rev-strip LEDs and music visualizer

- LED rev strip driven by real engine RPM via Blackboard listener on `VehicleDef.RPMValue`, normalized against `VehicleEngineData.MaxRPM` per-vehicle.
- When the in-car radio is on (`VehicleDef.VehRadioState`), the rev strip switches to a music visualizer driven by WASAPI loopback capture (game-process audio only, configurable).
- Save-load-with-radio-on recovery via three delayed reseeds (0.5 s, 1.5 s, 3 s post-attach) since the radio component takes time to spin up.
- Belt-and-suspenders `@wrapMethod(VehicleComponent) OnRadioToggleEvent` catches any toggle that bypasses the Blackboard listener.

### Wheel button bindings

- 20 physical wheel controls (paddles, D-pad, A/B/X/Y, Start/Select, LSB/RSB, Plus/Minus, scroll click + CW + CCW, Xbox/Guide) each bindable to one of 36 in-game actions through a single native: `GWheel_SetInputBinding(inputId: Int32, action: Int32)`.
- Per-device DirectInput-button-index layouts; G923 Xbox layout empirically verified via the new `tools/input_probe` tool. G923 PS/PC, G920, G29, G27 fall back to the G923 Xbox layout until each is probed.
- D-pad and A default to MenuUp/Down/Left/Right/Confirm so the wheel navigates pause/map/inventory menus out of the box. Bindings are user-overridable; "None" truly disables the input. (CP2077's arrow keys are secondary vehicle controls, so a hardcoded menu-state-aware override would steer the car when the user pressed the D-pad with binding=None — that override was deliberately removed.)
- Low-level keyboard hook (`kbd_hook`) suppresses G HUB's synthetic vehicle-key events while V is on foot, while letting the plugin's own `SendInput` events through (tagged with `dwExtraInfo = 'gWHL'`).

### In-game settings (Mod Settings)

- Single `GWheelSettings` class drives the in-game settings page. Categories: Wheel input, Force feedback, Rev-strip LEDs, Button bindings, Lower-cluster bindings, Startup, Debug.
- Hardware capability flags (`hasFfbHardware`, `hasRevLeds`, `hasRightCluster`) hide irrelevant sections on wheels without that hardware.
- This release bundles a patched build of `jackhumbert/mod_settings` v0.2.21 that adds a `ModSettings.hidden` runtime property. Without the patch, the three capability flags would render as visible Bool toggles in the settings UI. The patch is API-compatible with upstream; the FOMOD installer overwrites the user's stock Mod Settings DLL on install.

### Distribution

- Single FOMOD step at install time: Pon pon shi greeting on / off (writes `red4ext/plugins/gwheel/config.json`). All other prerequisites (RED4ext, ArchiveXL, Mod Settings, G HUB) are declared as Nexus required-mods rather than nagged through the installer.
- New dev tool: `tools/input_probe` — empirical button / POV / axis edge logger for building per-device layouts. Replaces the removed `tools/sigfinder` (obsolete now that vehicle hook drift is RED4ext's problem).
- New dev tool: `tools/wheel_reset` — pushes G HUB's controller properties back to the wheel; useful when firmware is stuck in an SDK-managed state.

### What's NOT here

- No surface-material FFB mapping yet. The raycast and material-CName plumbing in `gwheel_surface.reds` works end-to-end, but mapping CNames to FFB baselines is dormant. Vanilla CP2077 doesn't appear to assign physmats to off-road geometry, so dirt / sand / gravel never surface; on-road materials by themselves don't produce a useful signal. See `gwheel/src/wheel.cpp::SurfaceBaselineForMaterial` for where to wire it in if you can capture useful CNames.
- No handbrake-axis injection. The wheel's handbrake position is read but the corresponding game struct field offset hasn't been identified.
- No menu-state-aware binding override (see Wheel button bindings above).
